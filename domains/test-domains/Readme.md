This directory should contains very simple problems that the planner should
solve with no effort. The intended objective is to be able to check that there
is no regressions (after a commit, all domains in this directory should still be solvable).

If a problem is not solvable while it should be. It should be placed in the "buggy" directory so developers can check it and move it her once the problem is solved.
