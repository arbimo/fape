This folder is dedicated to cloning and building the libraries that FAPE uses.

Running `./update.sh` should clone the different repositories and
build them in place. The resulting jars are copied into the local ivy2 
repositories (from where they can be used to compile FAPE).

The only requirement is to have SBT (Simple Build Tool).
Instructions for installing SBT can be found at
http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html

# Graph

git://trac.laas.fr/git/robots/fape-graphs

A scala graph library. Those are used in multiple places in FAPE.
The focus of this graph library is to allow cheap copy operation to maintain
nearly identical versions of a graph with very low memory overhead.


# Constraints:

git://trac.laas.fr/git/robots/fape-constraints

A library for constraints processing.
It implements a simplistic binding manager as well as several algorithm
for STN and STNU constraint propagation and consistency checking.

# Anml

git://trac.laas.fr/git/robots/fape-anml

An ANML parser built with scala's combinator parsers.
