This folder is dedicated to cloning and building the libraries that FAPE uses.

Running `./update.sh` should clone the different repositories and
build them in place. The resulting jars are copied into the local ivy2 
repositories (from where they can be used to compile FAPE).


# Graph
A scala graph library. Those are used in multiple places in FAPE.
The focus of this graph library is to allow cheap copy operation to maintain
nearly identical versions of a graph with very low memory overhead.

# Constraints:
A library for constraints processing.
It implements a simplistic binding manager as well as several algorithm
for STN and STNU constraint propagation and consistency checking.

# Anml
An ANML parser built with scala's combinator parsers
